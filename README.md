## Description
The Tech Blog is a CMS-style blog site where users can make an account and publish articles & blog posts (text only currently), and comment on other users' posts. There is a simple dashboard page that shows all of your posts with the option to edit them, and a homepage that displays all posts by all users, sorted by the most recent posts from top to bottom.

## Usage
Upon visiting the site for the first time, a user should click on the 'login' button in the top right corner to be re-routed to the login page. From there is a link to signup where you will be asked to enter a username and password. Once logged in, that username and passord will be saved in the databse for furture use.
